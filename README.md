AI Powered News Search App (Level-1)

**OVERVIEW**

In this project, we built our own news mining web application using Node-RED App and the IBM Watson Discovery Service, which was then integrated with Slack. 
To do this, we:
* Build a Server Side Application using Node-RED
* Used the pre-built Watson Discovery News collection
* Accessed the Watson Discovery Service through the Discovery API

Moreover, we:
* Used a Slack interface to query the data
* Finally, deployed the app on IBM Cloud

**PURPOSE**
 
The web is home to massive amounts of data, with more being created every day. Organizations can harness this constant stream of information to gain understanding, plan strategies, and find opportunities. Enriched news data can help applications make dynamic connections across current events faster.
